# Java Based Sudoku
## Project Description

> Note:  This project is complete, There likely wont be any updates :/ 

Programmed this to refresh my java knowledge. I dislike tutorials and so my code had little direction to begin with so older commits can have large jumps as I refactored multiple times.
 I wanted a simple challenge to reteach myself java; Random projects are the best way to learn in my experience. The program has nothing special,  A start menu with difficulties/options and then after, the board where you play sudoku and it error checks, times, and refreshes upon winning.
 
 Not the cleanest code but anyone is welcome to learn what they can from it. Hopefully it helps someone in the future.
